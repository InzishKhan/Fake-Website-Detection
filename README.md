## Problem Statement 

In the contemporary digital landscape, the proliferation of
 cyber security threats has become a matter of grave concern for
 both individuals and institutions. Of the various forms of cyber
 attacks, phishing stands out as one of the most ubiquitous,
 wherein attackers employ deceptive tactics to procure sensitive
 user information like username, password and credit card
 information by posing as legitimate entities.[[1]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/345977903_A_Novel_Ensemble_Machine_Learning_Method_to_Detect_Phishing_Attack)

 Currently, thereâ€™s a noticeable scarcity of resources
specifically dedicated to fake website detection, leaving users vulnerable to on-
line scams and threats.

In order to effectively and precisely identify phishing sites, it is imperative that a better system be created that combines feature engineering, advanced machine learning techniques, and behavioral analysis. The suggested methodology seeks to solve these issues in order to increase online user security, safeguard sensitive data, and promote a safer online environment.
