## Inspiration ðŸ¤”
Fraudulent websites pose as legitimate sources of information, goods, 
product and services are propagating and resulted in loss of billions of dollars targeting indivisuals , organization and even governments.Websites 
are great tool to access information, services and product, however like any other 
online service, they can be utilized by fraudsters to prey on victims and propagate 
fraud.

Phishing attacks have been a persistent threat, with over 300,000 phishing attacks occurring every quarter as of Q2 2023. The first quarter of 2023 saw more than 40,000 unique email subject lines used in phishing attempts each month, indicating a high level of tailoring and sophistication by attackers.[[2]](https://www.comparitech.com/blog/vpn-privacy/phishing-statistics-facts/)

## Problem Statement 

In the contemporary digital landscape, the proliferation of
 cyber security threats has become a matter of grave concern for
 both individuals and institutions. Of the various forms of cyber
 attacks, phishing stands out as one of the most ubiquitous,
 wherein attackers employ deceptive tactics to procure sensitive
 user information like username, password and credit card
 information by posing as legitimate entities.[[1]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/345977903_A_Novel_Ensemble_Machine_Learning_Method_to_Detect_Phishing_Attack)

 Currently, thereâ€™s a noticeable scarcity of resources
specifically dedicated to fake website detection, leaving users vulnerable to on-
line scams and threats.

In order to effectively and precisely identify phishing sites, it is imperative that a better system be created that combines feature engineering, advanced machine learning techniques, and behavioral analysis. The suggested methodology seeks to solve these issues in order to increase online user security, safeguard sensitive data, and promote a safer online environment.

## Introduction

The basic goal of this is to develop an effective fraudulent website detection model that should be able to address these 
challenges and deliver accurate results within a reasonable time frame. The contribution 
proposes a fraudulent website detection model based on sentiment analysis of textual 
contents (URLS and HTML) of a given website and supervised machine learning techniques.

Further in the upcoming sections we are going to explain in more detail every modeule giving a breif overlook of all the steps done in the code and what problems were being faced during the execution of our model.

## Roadmap

- Dataset regarding malicious URLS is collected from open-source platform eg. Kaggle 

- Performing Data Analysis and applying EDA Techniques
- Dividing the dataset into Train-Test split 
- Applying Supervised Machine Learning and  Deep Learning Models like Logistic Regression, SVM,Random Forest, 
- Evaluating the models using the Performance Metrics and unveiling the magic of data through colorful Visualization plots.
- Concluding the results by comparing the Applied Models.
